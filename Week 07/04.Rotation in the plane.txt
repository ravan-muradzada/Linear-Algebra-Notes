Rotation in the plane refers to the movement of points in a two-dimensional space around a fixed point, called the center of rotation, by a certain angle. This transformation preserves distances and angles, meaning that the shape and size of objects remain unchanged, but their orientation changes.

If the rotation happens according to origin (0, 0), the matrix for a counterclockwise rotation by an angle θ around the origin in the plane is:

R(θ) = [[cos(θ), -sin(θ)], [sin(θ), cos(θ)]]

If it is according to another point (x, y), we need to multiply R(θ) with [[x], [y]].


-----------------

To calculate the point after the rotation, we put the degree of the rotation on θ and then multiply it with [[x], [y]].
