A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, if you have a vector space V, a subset W of V is called a subspace if W satisfies all the properties required for a vector space.


Conditions for a Subset to Be a Subspace

For a subset W ⊆ V to be considered a subspace of the vector space V, it must meet the following conditions:

1.Non-emptiness (contains the zero vector): The subset W must include the zero vector of the vector space V. This means that 0∈W.

2.Closure under addition: If two vectors u and v belong to W, then their sum u+v must also belong to W.

3.Closure under scalar multiplication: If a vector u belongs to W, and c is any scalar from the field over which the vector space is defined, then the product cu must also belong to W.

If these three conditions are satisfied, then W is indeed a subspace of V.


Example of a Subspace

1. Zero subspace 
The set containing only the zero vector, W={0}, is always a subspace of any vector space V. It satisfies all three conditions trivially.

2.Real Coordinate Space(R^3)

Consider V = R^3, which is the space of all 3-dimensional vectors.
The set of all vectors of the form (x,0,0), where x is any real number, it is a subspace ofIt includes the zero vector (0,0,0), and it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

3.Set of Polynomials:

Let V be the space of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 3.
The set of all polynomials of degree exactly 2 is a subspace of V because it satisfies the subspace conditions.

Importance of Subspaces

Subspaces help to analyze vector spaces by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable parts. They are central to concepts such as:

-Linear combinations: A subspace can be thought of as the set of all linear combinations of some vectors.
-Span and Basis: The span of a set of vectors is a subspace. The basis of a vector space is a set of vectors whose span equals the entire vector space.
-Dimension: A subspace has a dimension that is less than or equal to the dimension of the original vector space.

Testing a Set for Being a Subspace

To determine whether a given set is a subspace, verify if it:

-Contains the zero vector.
-Is closed under addition (check if adding two vectors from the set still results in a vector within the set).
-Is closed under scalar multiplication (check if multiplying any vector from the set by a scalar results in a vector within the set).


If all these conditions are met, the set is indeed a subspace of the given vector space.
