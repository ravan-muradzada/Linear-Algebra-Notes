A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental in linear algebra and are used to represent systems of linear equations, transformations in geometry, and various applications in computer science, physics, and engineering.

There are some kinds of matrices:

-Square Matrix: A matrix with the same number of rows and columns (m=n). Example: 3×3 matrix. Only they have determinants and inverse versions.

-Row Matrix: A matrix with only one row (1×n).

-Column Matrix: A matrix with only one column (m×1).

-Zero Matrix (Null Matrix): A matrix where all elements are zero.

-Diagonal Matrix: A square matrix where all elements outside the main diagonal are zero.
[[1, 0],
 [0, 1]]

-Identity Matrix: A diagonal matrix where all elements on the main diagonal are 1. It is denoted as I. Other elements are 0.

-Symmetric Matrix: A square matrix that is equal to its transpose (A = A^T). This is a matrix whose lower and upper parts of the main diagonal are the symmetric.

-Lower Triangular Matrix: A lower triangular matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements above the main diagonal are zero. 

-Upper Triangular Matrix: An upper triangular matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements below the main diagonal are zero.
