There are four kinds of matrix operations:

1) Matrix addition:

Firstly it should be known that two matrices can be summed when both have the same dimensions. 
To find out of the result of the addition, all elements should be summed respectively and put the same place in the result matrix.

2) Matrix subtraction:

This process is similar to addition, so we just need to subtract the elements respectively and put them to the same place in the result matrix.

3) Scalar Multiplication:

In scalar multiplication, each element of a matrix is multiplied by a constant (scalar).

4) Matrix multiplication:

To be able to multiply two matrices, the number of the columns in the first matrix should be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
So, the number of rows in the first matrix will be the number of the rows in the result matrix. 
And the number of the columns in the second matrix will be the number of the columns in the second matrix.

A (m x n) * B (n x k) = C (m x k).


How to multiply two matrices?

The rows of the first matrix should be multiplied with the columns of the second matrix.

A = [
    [1, 2, -1],
    [3, 1, 4]
]

B = [
    [2, 1],
    [-1, 6],
    [7, 2]
]

It is possible to multiply these matrices.

A * B = C 

C = [
    [a, b],
    [c, d]
]

Here:
a = (1 * 2) + (2 * -1) + (-1 * 7) = -7
b = (1 * 1) + (2 * 6) + (-1 * 2) = 11

c = (3 * 2) + (1 * -1) + (4 * 7) = 33
d = (3 * 1) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 2) = 17

C = [
    [-7, 11],
    [33, 17]
]

Algorithm is simply like that:
The first row elements in matrix 1 are multiplied with the first columns elements in matrix 2. 
And this process continues for all columns in the second matrix. After the first row elements in matrix 1 
are multiplied with proper elements in matrix 2 and put their places in the first row in the result array,
we can do the same process with the second row in matrix 1.

Let's imagine i1 and j1 represent the row number and column number respectively in the first matrix.
And imagine, i2 and j2 also represent the row number and column number respectively in the second matrix.

If the (i1)th row is multiplied with j2 column, the result will be result[i1][j2].

-------------------------------------

Some cases in multiplication:

1) A * B != B * A 
2) A * I = A 
3) I * A = A 
4) (A * B)^T = B^T * A^T. T is tranpose here.
5) A * A^-1 = I
