A standard matrix for a linear transformation is the matrix representation of the transformation with respect to the standard basis vectors of the input and output spaces.

If we are given basis points, we can do smth like that:

T(1, 0) = (2, 3)
T(0, 1) = (4, 5)

T = [[2, 4], [3, 5]]

If we are given transformation like that:

T(x, y) = (ax+by, cx+dy)
a, b, c and d are constants.

T = [[a, b], [c, d]]
That is called standard matrix.
