First of all according to some criterias, the methods to solve systems can vary.

There are two branches of solutions:

1) If the count of the equations are equal to the count of the variables, these are the methods to solve the system:
    1) Gauss eliminating method 
    2) Gauss-Jordan eliminating method 
    3) Cramer method (using determinants)
    4) A^(-1) method (using inverse matrix)
    5) Row echelon method
    6) Row eliminated echelon method 

2) If the count of the equations are not equal to the count of the variables, these are the methods to solve the system:
    1) Row echelon method
    2) Row eliminated echelon method
