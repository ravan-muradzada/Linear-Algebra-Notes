1) Length of a vector:
v = (v1, v2, ..., vn)
||v|| = sqrt(v1^2 + v2^2 +..+ vn^2)


2) Unit vector in the direction of v:
u = v / ||v||
It has length 1 and the same direction as v. This is called unit vector(u) in the direction of v.


3) Distance between two vectors:
d(u, v) = ||u - v|| = sqrt((u1 - v1)^2 + (u2 - v2)^2)


4) Dot product and the angle betweeen two vectors:
cos(a) = (u1*v1 - u2*v2) / (||u|| * ||v||)
