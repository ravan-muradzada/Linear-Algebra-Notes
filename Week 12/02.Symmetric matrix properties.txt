Imagine we have matrix A. If A = A^T, this is symmetric, otherwise nonsymmetric matrix.


1) If A is a real symmetric nxn matrix, then its eugen-values are all real.

2) For symmetric matrix, eigen-vectors are linearly independent.

3) For symmetric matrix, two eigen-vectors corresponding two distinct eigen-values are orthogonal to each other.

4) All real symmetric matrices are diagonalisable.
