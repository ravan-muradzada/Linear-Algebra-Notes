To use LU factorization, actually we have easier way.
So, instead of finding the elementary matrices and working on them, we can just find directly L and U.
(We can use this method only we do not need to swap the rows while getting Gauss form).
A = L * U 

First, we need to find U.
To find U, we need to make the lower part of the main diagonal zero.

To find out L, first we create new matrix with the size of the given matrix and fill main diagonal with ones, and the part above this diagonal with zeros.
While the process our goal is filling lower part.
For that, we just need to follow the ways while finding U.
To make zero any element in U matrix, we need to use row multiplication and addition. Here we need to put the inverse of coefficent to L matrix.
After the process, if any element is not found for L, we put 0 for here.

Example:

A = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [2, 4, 7],
    [3, 6, 10]
]

Let's find U.

[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [2, 4, 7],
    [3, 6, 10]
]

-2R1 + R2 -> R2 
-3R1 + R3 -> R3

[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
We have found U matrix.

L matrix is like that:

[
    [1, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 0],
    [3, 0, 1]
]
