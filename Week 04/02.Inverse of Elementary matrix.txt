To find out the inverse of elementary matrices, we have better way.
So, first of all, we need to know this elementary matrix how was got.

1) If the elementary matrix (E) has been got by using row swapping:

The inverse of this type of elementary matrix is itself.

So we can check it by multiplying it with itself. If the result is identity matrix, that means, this elementary matrix has been got by swapping rows.


2) If the elementary matrix (E) has been got by using row multiplication:

We can find its inverse changing all numbers except 0 and 1, with their reciprocal version.

Imagine we have:
E = [
    [2, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]

E^-1 = [
    [1/2, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]


3) If the elementary matrix has been got by using row addition:

We can find its invese by changing all numbers except 0 and 1, with their inverse.

Example:

E = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [-3, 0, 1]
]

E^-1 = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [3, 0, 1]
]
