1) The multiplication of eugen-values is equal to a determinant of the matrix.


2) The sum of eugen-values is equal to the sum of main diagonal elements in the given matrix. This sum is called trace: tr(A).


3) Sometimes we are given characteristic polynom. We should make equal it to zero and find ÊŽ's.


4) Eugen-values and eugen-vectors are used in diagonalization and finding high order powers of the matrices in linear algebra.
