A linear combination is an expression that involves multiplying vectors by scalars (real or complex numbers) and then adding the results together. In a vector space, a linear combination represents a way to generate new vectors using a set of given vectors and scalar coefficients.

Definition of Linear Combination

Given a set of vectors v1, v2, .., vn in a vector space V, and scalars c1, c2, .., cn the expression:

c1v1 + c2v2 + .. + cnvn

s called a linear combination of the given vectors.

-The scalars are called coefficients.
-The given vectors are called basis vectors.

--------------------------------------------

Example:

The vectors are given: v1=(2,1,-3); v2=(3,1,5); v3=(0,2,4). Show that w=(3,-4,5) is linear combination of the given vectors.

w = c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3

c1*(2,1,-3) + c2*(3,1,5) + c3*(0,2,4) = (3,-4,5)

Calculating the equation we can find c1, c2 and c3.

Why Are Linear Combinations Important?

Linear combinations are fundamental in linear algebra because they help define many key concepts, such as:

-Span:
The set of all possible linear combinations of a set of vectors forms the span of those vectors. If the span covers the entire vector space, the vectors are said to span the vector space.

-Linear Independence:
A set of vectors is linearly independent if the only way to obtain the zero vector as a linear combination is by setting all coefficients to zero. Otherwise, the vectors are linearly dependent.

-Basis and Dimension:
A basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors whose span is the entire space. The dimension of the vector space is the number of vectors in a basis.

-Solving Systems of Linear Equations:
Systems of linear equations can be interpreted as finding linear combinations of vectors that satisfy certain conditions.


Linear combinations are essential for understanding vector spaces, solving linear equations, and many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.
