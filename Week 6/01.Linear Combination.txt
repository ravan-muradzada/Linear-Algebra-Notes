A linear combination is an expression that involves multiplying vectors by scalars (real or complex numbers) and then adding the results together. In a vector space, a linear combination represents a way to generate new vectors using a set of given vectors and scalar coefficients.

Definition of Linear Combination

Given a set of vectors v1, v2, .., vn in a vector space V, and scalars c1, c2, .., cn the expression:

c1v1 + c2v2 + .. + cnvn

s called a linear combination of the given vectors.

-The scalars are called coefficients.
-The given vectors are called basis vectors.

--------------------------------------------

Example:

The vectors are given: v1=(2,1,-3); v2=(3,1,5); v3=(0,2,4). Show that w=(3,-4,5) is linear combination of the given vectors.

w = c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3

c1*(2,1,-3) + c2*(3,1,5) + c3*(0,2,4) = (3,-4,5)

Calculating the equation we can find c1, c2 and c3.

Why Are Linear Combinations Important?

Linear combinations are fundamental in linear algebra because they help define many key concepts, such as:

-Span

-Linear Independence

-Basis and Dimension

-Solving Systems of Linear Equations
