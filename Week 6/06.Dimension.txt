In linear algebra, the dimension of a vector space refers to the number of vectors in a basis for that space. A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the vector space. The dimension essentially tells you the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any vector within the space.

So imagine we have the set like S = {v1, v2, v3}. Let's assume this set is basis on R^3 space.
So, the length of this set is the dimension of a vector space. (Here the dimension is 3).
