There are some specific features of determinant:


1. If all the elements of any row or column are zero, its determinant is 0.

2. If any row or column of a matrix is a scalar multiple of another row or column, the determinant of the matrix is zero.
Example:
[[1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 4], [5, 10, 15]] (first and the last row).

3. If we change the places of rows or columns, the determinant's sign changes.
Example:
det([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, k]]) = 10
Thus: det([[a, b, c], [g, h, k], [d, e, f]]) = -10

4. If we multiply any row or column with a number, we should multiply its determinant with this number, too.

5. Adding or subtracting one row of a matrix to/from another row, even after multiplying it by a scalar, does not change the determinant of the matrix. It is just for rows, not columns.

6. The determinant of triangular, upper or lower matrices is equal to the multiplication of diagonal elements.
(Triangular: Except the main diagonal, all elements are zero; Upper: The lower part of the main diagonal is zero; Lower: The upper part of the main diagonal is zero).

So, from here, we get another method to calculate determinant: We need to make zero lower part of the main diagonal (setting Upper diagonal matrix) and then find the multiplication of the diagonal elements.


7. det(A*B) = det(A) * det(B)

8. det(A^-1) = 1 / det(A)

9. det(A^T) = det(A)

10. det(A^n) = det(A)^n

11. det(k*A) = k^n * det(A). Here n is the number of rows in A matrix.

12. If only if det(A) != 0, then A is invertible (nonsingular) matrix. It also means, A can be written as the product of elementary matrices.
