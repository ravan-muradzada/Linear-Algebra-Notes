Determinat helps us when we want to determine the matrix has inverse or not (invertible or not).

First, the matrix should be square, otherwise it is not invertible matrix. Then its determinant should be different than 0. If the determinant is zero, it is not invertible.

If the matrix is invertible (det(A) != 0), it is called nonsingular matrix.
If the matrix is not invertible (det(A) = 0), it is called singular matrix.
